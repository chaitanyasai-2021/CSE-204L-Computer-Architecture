# CSE 204L: Computer Organization and Architecture Lab 🚀

Welcome to the **CSE 204L - Computer Organization and Architecture Lab** repository! This collection of assembly language programs demonstrates fundamental concepts in computer architecture, using assembly for practical applications and exercises. Each project is crafted to enhance understanding of low-level programming and hardware interaction concepts. 🖥️

## Repository Contents 📂

This repository includes the following assembly language programs:

1. [**Average of Numbers**](average.asm) 📊  
   Calculate the average of a set of numbers.

2. [**Copy Characters**](copy_chars.asm) ✍️  
   Copy characters from one segment to another in memory.

3. [**GCD Calculation**](gcd.asm) 🔢  
   Compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

4. [**Largest Number Finder**](largest_number.asm) 🔍  
   Identify the largest number in an array.

5. [**LCM Calculation**](lcm.asm) 📐  
   Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

6. [**Matching Characters**](matching_chars.asm) 🔎  
   Check if characters match between two segments.

7. [**Count Vowels**](vowel_count.asm) 🗣️  
   Count the number of vowels in a given string.

8. [**Print 0 to 9**](print_numbers.asm) 🔢  
   Print numbers from 0 to 9 sequentially.

9. [**Sorting Array**](sorting.asm) 📈  
   Sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run these assembly programs, you’ll need:
- An assembler such as **MASM** or **TASM**.
- A DOS emulator (e.g., **DOSBox**) if you’re working on a non-DOS operating system.

Clone this repository to get started:
```bash
